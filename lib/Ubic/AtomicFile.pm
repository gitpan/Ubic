=head1 NAME

Ubic::AtomicFile - atomic file operations

=head1 VERSION

version 1.36_02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Ubic::AtomicFile;

    Ubic::AtomicFile::store("blah\n" => "/var/lib/blah");

    # store but don't sync content to disk
    Ubic::AtomicFile::store("blah\n" => "/var/lib/blah", { sync => 0 });

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item B<store($data, $file)>

=item B<store($data, $file, $options)>

Store C<$data> into C<$file> atomically. Temporary C<$file.new> will be created and then renamed to C<$file>.

If I<sync> flag is set and false in C<$options> hash then data will not be synced on disk before file is renamed (should be faster, but you can lose your data - see comments in code).
