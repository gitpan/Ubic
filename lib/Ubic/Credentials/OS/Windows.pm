Ubic::Credentials::OS::Windows - dummy credentials module

=head1 VERSION

version 1.33_04

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module does nothing and always says that credentials are good.

If you are interested in proper Win32 credentials support, look for the patch I<9581a96> in git repo.

You might also want to contact CPAN user I<MITHALDU>, he provided that patch and was generally interested in Win32 port some time ago.
