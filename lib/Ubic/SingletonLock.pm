=head1 NAME

Ubic::SingletonLock - lock which can be safely created several times from the same process without deadlocking

=head1 VERSION

version 1.33_03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Ubic::SingletonLock;

    $lock = Ubic::SingletonLock->new($file);
    $lock_again = Ubic::SingletonLock->new($file); # this works, unlike Ubic::Lockf which would deadlock at this moment
    undef $lock;

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<< Ubic::SingletonLock->new($filename) >>

=item B<< Ubic::SingletonLock->new($filename, $options) >>

Construct new singleton lock.

Consequent invocations with the same C<$filename> will return the same object if previous object still exists somewhere in process memory.

Any options will be passed directly to L<Ubic::Lockf>.

=back

=head1 BUGS AND CAVEATS

This module is a part of ubic implementation and shouldn't be used in non-core code.

It passes options blindly to Ubic::Lockf, so following code will not work correctly:

    $lock = Ubic::SingletonLock->new("file", { shared => 1 });
    $lock = Ubic::SingletonLock->new("file"); # this call will just return cached shared lock again
