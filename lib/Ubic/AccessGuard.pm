=head1 NAME

Ubic::AccessGuard - guard for operations with temporarily different effective uid

=head1 VERSION

version 1.47

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Ubic::AccessGuard;

    # change effective uid and effective gid to $credentials
    $guard = Ubic::AccessGuard->new($credentials);

    # change them back
    undef $guard;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ubic::AccessGuard temporarily changes effective uid and gid, and restore it back on destruction.

It's usage is limited, because when effective uid is not equal to real uid, perl automatically turns on tainted mode.
Because of this, only tainted-safe code should be called when AccessGuard is active.
Ubic doesn't start services under this guard, but uses it when acquiring locks and writing service status files.
