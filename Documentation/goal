Common tasks and problems:
 - race conditions between watchdog and manually invoked init script can leave system in unpredictable state
 - double start / double stop should always be safe
 - some init scripts require to mark service as "started" even if start currently fails
 - watchdog and init script should share common code of status checking
 - you must obey http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/iniscrptact.html.

Also, there are more complicated init scirpts:
1) with subparts: start-fastcgi, start-memcached, start-lighttpd
2) with externally specified configs: /etc/init.d/CORBA restart ppb_searcher
Final solution should be easy-to-use in these cases too.
