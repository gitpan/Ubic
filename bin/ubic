=head1 NAME

ubic - command-line frontend to ubic services

=head1 VERSION

version 1.37_03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ubic [-f] COMMAND [SERVICE]...

 Supported commands:
    status
    start
    stop
    restart
    reload
    force-reload
    cached-status
    try-restart
    ...and any service-specific commands

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program can start, stop and display status of any services. It is a main tool for system administrator who wants to operate ubic services.

B<ubic> conforms to LSB interface for init scripts (L<http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/iniscrptact.html>) with obvious exception that it is invoked as C<ubic COMMAND SERVICE> instead of C</etc/init.d/SERVICE COMMAND>.

It also can operate several services at once:

=over

=item *

if invoked as C<ubic start service1 service2>, it will try to start both services;

=item *

if invoked as C<ubic start multiservice>, it will start all subservices of given multiservice;

=item *

if invoked as C<ubic start>, it will start all existing services.

=back

When operating multiservices, flag B<-f> can be used to force operations on "protected" multiservices. For example, you can't restart all services on host using C<ubic restart>, you have to say C<ubic restart -f>.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

When managing one service, exit status conforms to LSB specification when it makes sense.

When managing several services, exit code is non-zero if any service fails, and zero if all operations succeeded.
